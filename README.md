## Project Description

**DMM Download Helper** is a browser extension designed specifically for the DMM (dmm.com / dmm.co.jp) platform. It can automatically capture the MPD manifest address and the corresponding decryption key (Widevine/ClearKey) during video playback, and generate the download command line `N_m3u8DL-RE` with one click.
